When The Alchemist was first published twenty-five years ago in my native
Brazil, no one noticed. A bookseller in the northeast corner of the country told
me that only one person purchased a copy the first week of its release. It took
another six months for the bookseller to unload a second copy—and that was to
the same person who bought the first! And who knows how long it took to sell
the third.
By the end of the year, it was clear to everyone that The Alchemist wasn’t
working. My original publisher decided to cut me loose and cancelled our
contract. They wiped their hands of the project and let me take the book with
me. I was forty-one and desperate.
But I never lost faith in the book or ever wavered in my vision. Why?
Because it was me in there, all of me, heart and soul. I was living my own
metaphor. A man sets out on a journey, dreaming of a beautiful or magical place,
in pursuit of some unknown treasure. At the end of his journey, the man realizes
the treasure was with him the entire time. I was following my Personal Legend,
and my treasure was my capacity to write.
