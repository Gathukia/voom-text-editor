The
Alchemist
became
a
spontaneousand
organicPhenomenon
The
book
hit
the
New
York
Times
bestseller
list
an
important
milestone
for
any
author
and
stayed
there
for
more
than
three
hundred
weeks
It
has
since
been
translated
into
more
than
eighty
different
languages
the
most
translated
book
by
any
living
author
and
is
widely
considered
one
of
the
ten
best
books
of
the
twentieth
century
People
continue
to
ask
me
if
I
knew
The
Alchemist
would
be
such
a
huge
success
The
answer
is
no
I
had
no
idea
How
could
I
When
I
sat
down
to
write
The
Alchemist
all
I
knew
is
that
I
wanted
to
write
about
my
soul
I
wanted
to
write
about
my
quest
to
find
my
treasure
I
wanted
to
follow
the
omens
because
I
knew
even
then
that
the
omens
are
the
language
of
God
Though
The
Alchemist
is
now
celebrating
its
twenty
fifth
anniversary
it
is
no
relic
of
the
past
The
book
is
still
very
much
alive
Like
my
heart
and
like
my
soul
it
continues
to
live
every
day
because
my
heart
and
soul
are
in
it
And
my
heart
and
soul
is
your
heart
and
soul
I
am
Santiago
the
shepherd
boy
in
search
of
my
treasure
just
as
you
are
Santiago
the
shepherd
boy
in
search
of
your
own
The
story
of
one
person
is
the
story
of
everyone
and
one
mans
quest
is
the
quest
of
all
of
humanity
which
is
why
I
believe
The
Alchemist
continues
all
these
years
later
to
resonate
with
people
from
different
cultures
all
around
the
world
touching
them
emotionally
and
spiritually
equally
without
prejudice
I
re
read
The
Alchemist
regularly
and
every
time
I
do
I
experience
the
same
sensations
I
felt
when
I
wrote
it
And
here
is
what
I
feel
I
feel
happiness
because
it
is
all
of
me
and
all
of
you
simultaneously
I
feel
happiness
too
because
I
know
I
can
never
be
alone
Wherever
I
go
people
understand
me
They
understand
my
soul
This
continues
to
give
me
hope
When
I
read
about
clashes
around
the
worldpolitical
clashes
economic
clashes
cultural
clashes
I
am
reminded
that
it
is
within
our
power
to
build
a
bridge
to
be
crossed
Even
if
my
neighbor
doesnt
understand
my
religion
or
understand
my
politics
he
can
understand
my
story
If
he
can
understand
my
story
then
hes
never
too
far
from
me
It
is
always
within
my
power
to
build
a
bridge
There
is
always
a
chance
for
reconciliation
a
chance
that
one
day
he
and
I
will
sit
around
a
table
together
and
put
an
end
to
our
history
of
clashes
And
on
this
day
he
will
tell
me
his
story
and
I
will
tell
him
mine
ÿshes.
and
on
this
day,
he
will
tell
me
his
story
and
i
will
tell
him
mine.
