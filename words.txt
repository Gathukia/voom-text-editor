when
the
alchemist
was
first
published
twenty
five
years
ago
in
my
native
brazil
no
one
noticed
a
bookseller
in
the
northeast
corner
of
the
country
told
me
that
only
one
person
purchased
a
copy
the
first
week
of
its
release
it
took
another
six
months
for
the
bookseller
to
unload
a
second
copyand
that
was
to
the
same
person
who
bought
the
first
and
who
knows
how
long
it
took
to
sell
the
third
by
the
end
of
the
year
it
was
clear
to
everyone
that
the
alchemist
wasnt
working
my
original
publisher
decided
to
cut
me
loose
and
cancelled
our
contract
they
wiped
their
hands
of
the
project
and
let
me
take
the
book
with
me
i
was
forty
one
and
desperate
but
i
never
lost
faith
in
the
book
or
ever
wavered
in
my
vision
why
because
it
was
me
in
there
all
of
me
heart
and
soul
i
was
living
my
own
metaphor
a
man
sets
out
on
a
journey
dreaming
of
a
beautiful
or
magical
place
in
pursuit
of
some
unknown
treasure
at
the
end
of
his
journey
the
man
realizes
the
treasure
was
with
him
the
entire
time
i
was
following
my
personal
legend
and
my
treasure
was
my
capacity
to
write
and
i
wanted
to
share
this
treasure
with
the
world
as
i
wrote
in
the
alchemist
when
you
want
something
the
whole
universe
conspires
to
help
you
i
started
knocking
on
the
doors
of
other
publishers
one
opened
and
the
publisher
on
the
other
side
believed
in
me
and
my
book
and
agreed
to
give
the
alchemist
a
second
chance
slowly
through
word
of
mouth
it
finally
started
to
sellthree
thousand
then
six
thousand
ten
thousandbook
by
book
gradually
throughout
the
year
eight
months
later
an
american
visiting
brazil
picked
up
a
copy
of
the
alchemist
in
a
local
bookstore
he
wanted
to
translate
the
book
and
help
me
find
a
publisher
in
the
united
states
harpercollins
agreed
to
bring
it
to
an
american
audience
publishing
it
with
great
fanfare
ads
in
the
new
york
times
and
influential
news
magazines
radio
and
television
interviews
but
it
still
took
some
time
to
sell
slowly
finding
its
audience
in
the
united
states
by
word
of
mouth
just
as
it
did
in
brazil
and
then
one
day
bill
clinton
was
photographed
leaving
the
white
house
with
a
copy
then
madonna
raved
about
the
book
to
vanity
fair
and
people
from
different
walks
of
lifefrom
rush
limbaugh
and
will
smith
to
college
students
and
soccer
momswere
suddenly
talking
about
it
the
alchemist
became
a
spontaneousand
organicphenomenon
the
book
hit
the
new
york
times
bestseller
list
an
important
milestone
for
any
author
and
stayed
there
for
more
than
three
hundred
weeks
it
has
since
been
translated
into
more
than
eighty
different
languages
the
most
translated
book
by
any
living
author
and
is
widely
considered
one
of
the
ten
best
books
of
the
twentieth
century
people
continue
to
ask
me
if
i
knew
the
alchemist
would
be
such
a
huge
success
the
answer
is
no
i
had
no
idea
how
could
i
when
i
sat
down
to
write
the
alchemist
all
i
knew
is
that
i
wanted
to
write
about
my
soul
i
wanted
to
write
about
my
quest
to
find
my
treasure
i
wanted
to
follow
the
omens
because
i
knew
even
then
that
the
omens
are
the
language
of
god
though
the
alchemist
is
now
celebrating
its
twenty
fifth
anniversary
it
is
no
relic
of
the
past
the
book
is
still
very
much
alive
like
my
heart
and
like
my
soul
it
continues
to
live
every
day
because
my
heart
and
soul
are
in
it
and
my
heart
and
soul
is
your
heart
and
soul
i
am
santiago
the
shepherd
boy
in
search
of
my
treasure
just
as
you
are
santiago
the
shepherd
boy
in
search
of
your
own
the
story
of
one
person
is
the
story
of
everyone
and
one
mans
quest
is
the
quest
of
all
of
humanity
which
is
why
i
believe
the
alchemist
continues
all
these
years
later
to
resonate
with
people
from
different
cultures
all
around
the
world
touching
them
emotionally
and
spiritually
equally
without
prejudice
i
re
read
the
alchemist
regularly
and
every
time
i
do
i
experience
the
same
sensations
i
felt
when
i
wrote
it
and
here
is
what
i
feel
i
feel
happiness
because
it
is
all
of
me
and
all
of
you
simultaneously
i
feel
happiness
too
because
i
know
i
can
never
be
alone
wherever
i
go
people
understand
me
they
understand
my
soul
this
continues
to
give
me
hope
when
i
read
about
clashes
around
the
worldpolitical
clashes
economic
clashes
cultural
clashes
I
am
reminded
that
it
is
within
our
power
to
build
a
bridge
to
be
crossed
Even
if
my
neighbor
doesnt
understand
my
religion
or
understand
my
politics
he
can
understand
my
story
If
he
can
understand
my
story
then
hes
never
too
far
from
me
It
is
always
within
my
power
to
build
a
bridge
There
is
always
a
chance
for
reconciliation
a
chance
that
one
day
he
and
I
will
sit
around
a
table
together
and
put
an
end
to
our
history
of
clashes
And
on
this
day
he
will
tell
me
his
story
and
I
will
tell
him
mine
